@autoBot04768645 twitter account
Requires: an internet connection to post

This console app will tweet to the twitter account above
  The program gives the user some options:
  tweet, tweet with media and a capption
  or
  tweet later

Things left to do: 
  1. ability to tweet with media later using the same helper program
  2. instead of full file paths modify them to relative file paths from the github file tree
  3. add a search for tweets function/ retweet
  4. add a web scrapper?? 
      -unclear what I would do with a web scrapper as of now but it sounds like it could be pretty sweet
        --generic news articles?
        --UK sporting events?
        --some major brand or even a smaller brand?
